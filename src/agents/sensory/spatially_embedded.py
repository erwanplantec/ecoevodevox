	This class implements a spatially embedded sensory system that processes chemical,

	system to determine which sensors are active and processes their inputs based on
	their spatial positions.

		sensor_expression_threshold (float): Minimum threshold for sensor activation.
		sensor_activation (Callable): Activation function for sensor outputs (default: tanh).
		border_threshold (float): Threshold for determining if a neuron is on the border.
